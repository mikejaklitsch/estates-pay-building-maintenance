# Fraction of building maintenance borne by the estate system (0.0–1.0).
# At 1.0 estates cover all maintenance; at 0.2 they cover 20% (vanilla).

# NDefine::NEconomy::BUILDING_MAINTENANCE_PERCENT to match (1.0 → 0.0, 0.2 → 0.8, etc.)
# so the crown's direct maintenance share and estate burden sum to 1.0.
